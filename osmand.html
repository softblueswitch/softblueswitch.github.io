									<p1>OsmAnd (Open Street Map Automated Navigation Directions) is a navigation app for Android OS. It uses the Open Street Map (OSM) map database for its primary displays.

                                    Map data can be stored on the device for offline use. Using the device's GPS capabilities, OsmAnd offers routing, with visual and voice guidance, for car, bike, and pedestrian. All of the main functionalities work both online and offline.

                                    The paid version unlocks the download limit for offline maps and provides access to Wikipedia points of interest (POIs) and their descriptions from within the app.

                                        <h3>The Brief   </h3>
                                        <p>For the lanch of the iOS version of the OsmAnd app the developers wanted to rethink the UX paradigm. New functionality was to be introduced and this required research into how iPhone users will engage with the application in iOS. An app-wide review of the functionality of the current Andriod app was needed. To do this we  grouped the most-used functions into epics and wireframed the user stories that sit under these epics. Two main features were the initial focus of the UX design process - Compass and My Location. To implement improvements and introduce new functionality based on user feedback for these two epics we refined user group definitions and identifed critical paths in user journeys.</p>

                                                      <!--<em>Modal user flow for assigning an asset to a class with Classroom and Teams API integration</em>-->
                                            <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/osmand4.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                                              <h3>My Approach</h3>  
                                        <p>The scope of work was split into two stages:<br>

                                            1. Defining the high-level functional grouping and the semantics behind the grouping<br>
                                            2. Defining the user pathways to access the functionality in Compass and My Location<br><br>  

                                            First stage: Defining the high-level functional grouping.<br>
                                            This stage delivered a series of epics, each containing a number of sub-functions that compile to form a high level function like 'Navigation'. The basic interactions were outlined, such as how to download new maps, access the settings, etc. 
                                            The HUD (heads up display) was discussed, this was an ongoing discussion as the items to be included in the top level of the HUD are crucial. In the present configuration, the HUD often has items that can be accessed from elsewhere, making it confusing for the user as this could be interpreted to mean that there are two different UX paths whereas in fact the path is the same. 
                                            Therefore my remit was to develop design solutions to these potentially confusing issues, identify the best user pathways for accessing this functionality and completing a certain task, then design graphical representation of these pathways. <br><br>

                                            Second stage: Defining the user pathways for epics Compass and My Location in iOS
                                            From user research data we identified that the two most important epics in order of frequency of use and utility to the user were Compass and My Location. 
                                            We defined these epics in terms of why they are important to the user at this level and how the iOS hardware and system impacts on the UX design. 
                                            Then the stories that make up the epics were discussed in turn and the way UX will answer the issues was outlined. 
                                            Finally the various potential user journeys were mapped out and graphical representations of the journeys produced.  </p>
                                            
                                            
                                              <h3>User Stories</h3><br><br>
                                        <p>We identified four main user groups: <br>
                                            • Navigators<br>
                                            • Map Readers<br>
                                            • GPX Readers<br>
                                            • OSM Editors <br>

                                                      <h3>Design Challenges </h3>
                                        <p> The design strategy needed to pull focus on how secondary school teachers build classes and courses in Microsoft Teams or Google Classroom. Assigning a digital asset to the teacher's current Teams or Classroom social account had to be simple and sensitive to privacy and data security. By wireframing and simulating the process we were able to design a UI that was intuitive and engaging but also made the job easy for the engineers to write the API calls for both platforms with the same UX.</p>
