                                            <p1>During my tenure, I collaborated closely with the client project lead and story writer to guarantee the accurate representation of narrative functionality in user stories. Moreover, I ensured that these user stories remained feasible under all usability test-cases. Taking this a step further, I translated these stories into wireframes and maintained constant communication with the offshore engineer team to ensure the seamless execution of our final design output.<br><br>

                                            In addition to my role as a bridge between teams, I took charge of managing design and file systems across various stakeholders systems, maintaining a strong emphasis on QA and design consistency. This multifaceted responsibility demanded effective coordination and seamless communication to ensure all teams were aligned, and the project progressed smoothly toward its successful completion.</p1>

                                                In the pursuit of successfully tackling the intricate task of integrating MS Teams and Google Classroom, our team needed to craft innovative and cutting-edge UX solutions. These solutions had to be carefully designed to address the challenges and intricacies that arose from needing to maintain consistancy in the user experience for users of both social platforms. Prioritizing user experience and considering the distinct functionalities of both MS Teams and Google Classroom, our goal was to create a unified and efficient system that not only met but exceeded the expectations of all stakeholders involved. Our ultimate objective was to streamline the integration of these platforms with Pace, ensuring a smooth and productive experience for educators, students, and administrators alike. Through a combination of creativity, technical expertise, and user-centric design, we were dedicated to delivering a cohesive integration that unlocked new possibilities in the realm of virtual education..<br><br><br></p1>-->
