Clarity outperforms cleverness.
Frictionless design is never accidental.
Meaning is the true medium of design.
Design succeeds when intention becomes instinct.
Semantics shape behaviour more than aesthetics ever will.
The interface is only as intelligent as its language.
Elegance is just strategy made visible.
A seamless experience is built, not found.
Design is the art of making decisions disappear.
